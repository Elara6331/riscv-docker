# riscv-docker

This repo contains my custom dockerfiles for risc-v container images. You can find the containers I build from these in the [Packages](https://gitea.elara.ws/Elara6331/riscv-docker/packages) section of this repo.

The containers are stored on my gitea instance, so you can pull them like this:

```bash
docker pull gitea.elara.ws/elara6331/golang:latest
```
